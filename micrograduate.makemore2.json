For some epochs it decreases, but then it increases again, and vice versa. That question that arises from this observation is this: are we stepping too slow or too fast? Meaning, are we updating the parameters by a fraction of their gradients that is too small or too large? Such magnitude is determined by the step size, aka the learning rate. Therefore, the overarching question is: how do you determine this learning rate? How do we gain confidence that we are stepping with the right speed? Let’s see one way to determine the learning rate. We basically want to find a reasonable search range, if you will. What people usually do is they pick different learning rate values until they find a satisfactory one. Let’s try to find one that is better.
